I am focusing on getting a job than finishing my study these days.
<br>
Just finised reading web1 from 생활코딩
<br>
I want to know what CSS is
<br>
CSS I always heard of, CSS that always bothered me
<br>
but never knew what it is when I was running <a href="http://www.woocommerce.com>Woocommerce</a> and <a href="http://www.magento.com>magento</a> website.
<br>
Just asked for supports from the company I purchased solutions.
<br>
That was quite enough, not much problems
<br>
But to learn something is enjoyable.
<br>
So I'll watch the lessons today.
<br>
I want to be a programmer.
